## Technical Overview
### Purpose
Transform the MTV music video app into an authentic MTV experience with real popular music, clean minimalist interface, and classic MTV-style presentation that automatically fades UI elements for immersive viewing.

## User Experience Problems Identified
1. **Demo videos instead of real popular music** - Users want current hits, not sample videos
2. **Cluttered interface with persistent overlays** - "More videos" and other UI elements distract from content
3. **Static "Now Playing" info** - Should fade after 3 seconds like real MTV
4. **Non-MTV aesthetic** - Interface should feel like classic MTV channel experience

## Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[x] Both approval statuses verified (Capability Approval = "Approved")
-[x] Decision made (proceed)
-[x] Appropriate response provided

---

## Task 2: Analysis
**Purpose**: Analyze the current UI/UX and determine specific improvements needed.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Task 1 Completion | Must be "Passed" | Continue to next condition check | STOP - explain why you are stopping |
| Capability Status | "Ready for Analysis" | Continue to Analysis Process Section | SKIP to Task 3: Design |

Since the Capability Status is "Ready for Design" (not "Ready for Analysis"), we SKIP to Task 3: Design.

---

## Task 3: Design
**Purpose**: Create detailed UI/UX design specifications for the improved MTV experience.

### Pre-Conditions Verification (ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY)
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-----------|----------------|---------|----------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | continue to next pre-condition check | IMMEDIATE STOP |
| Capability Status | "Ready for Design" | continue to next section | SKIP to Task 4: Develop the Enablers |

### Perform Design
| Step | Action | Requirement |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Verify pre-conditions | ALL must be met |
| 2 | Set Capability Status | "In Design" |
| 3 | Design real music integration system | YouTube API query optimization for popular music |
| 4 | Design clean interface with auto-hide behavior | CSS animations and React state management |
| 5 | Design MTV visual theme | Color schemes, typography, classic MTV aesthetics |
| 6 | Design fade timing system | 3-second fade logic for Now Playing display |

### MTV Interface Design Specifications

#### Music Content Strategy
- **Primary Source**: YouTube Data API with music category filter
- **Query Strategy**: "music video 2024", "popular music video", "top hits"
- **Filtering**: English language, high view count, music category
- **Refresh Rate**: Every 6 hours to keep content fresh

#### UI Auto-Hide Behavior
- **Now Playing Info**: Show for 3 seconds at song start, then fade out
- **Controls**: Show on hover/touch, hide after 3 seconds of inactivity
- **Network Info**: Minimize to small icon, expand on click
- **Video Progress**: Thin line at bottom, no overlay

#### Classic MTV Aesthetic
- **Colors**: MTV orange (#FF6600), white text, black backgrounds
- **Typography**: Bold, clean fonts reminiscent of MTV branding
- **Layout**: Full-screen video with minimal overlay elements
- **Transitions**: Smooth fades, no jarring animations

### Post-Condition Transition
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Set Capability Status "Ready for Implementation"
