## Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
