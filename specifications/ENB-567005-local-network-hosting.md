# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Parent Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next condition check |1. Stop all processing 2. Respond with "Parent Capability is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed."  |
| Enabler Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Enabler is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed." |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[ ] Both approval statuses verified
-[ ] Decision made (proceed/stop)
-[ ] Appropriate response provided

---

## Task 2: Analysis
**Purpose**: Analyze the current enabler and determine what new requirements or modifications need to be made.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Task 1 Completion | Must be "Passed" | Continue to next condition check | STOP - explain why you are stopping |
| Enabler Status | "Ready for Analysis" | Continue to Analysis Process Section | SKIP to Task 3: Design |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Perform Analysis
