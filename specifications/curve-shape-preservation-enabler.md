## Curve Stretching Algorithm Design

### Phase 1: Curve Analysis
```vba
Function AnalyzeCurveCharacteristics(curveData As Variant) As CurveAnalysis
    ' 1. Identify peaks and valleys
    ' 2. Detect inflection points
    ' 3. Calculate trend segments
    ' 4. Determine critical points
End Function
```

### Phase 2: Key Point Identification
```vba
Type KeyPoint
    TimePosition As Double     ' Original time position (0-1 normalized)
    Value As Double           ' Resource value at this point
    PointType As String       ' "Peak", "Valley", "Inflection", "Start", "End"
    Importance As Double      ' Weighting factor (0-1)
End Type
```

### Phase 3: Proportional Mapping
```vba
Function CalculateStretchMapping(originalDuration As Integer, targetDuration As Integer) As StretchMap
    Dim stretchFactor As Double
    stretchFactor = targetDuration / originalDuration

    ' Preserve relative timing of key points
    ' Apply stretch factor while maintaining proportions
End Function
```

### Phase 4: Value Interpolation
```vba
Function InterpolateValues(keyPoints As Collection, targetTimeline As Variant) As Variant
    ' Use spline interpolation to preserve curve smoothness
    ' Apply cubic spline between key points
    ' Ensure monotonic behavior where appropriate
End Function
```

## Mathematical Algorithms

### Peak Detection Algorithm
1. **First Derivative Analysis**: Calculate rate of change between adjacent points
2. **Zero Crossing Detection**: Identify where derivative changes sign
3. **Peak Classification**: Distinguish between significant peaks and noise
4. **Valley Identification**: Locate minimum points between peaks

### Curve Stretching Mathematics
```
Stretch Factor (SF) = Target Duration / Original Duration

For each original time point (t_orig):
t_new = t_orig √ó SF

For intermediate points, use cubic spline interpolation:
y(t) = a‚ÇÄ + a‚ÇÅ(t-t‚ÇÄ) + a‚ÇÇ(t-t‚ÇÄ)¬≤ + a‚ÇÉ(t-t‚ÇÄ)¬≥

Where coefficients preserve curve continuity and smoothness
```

### Shape Preservation Metrics
- **Peak Timing Accuracy**: ¬±2% of original relative timing
- **Peak Value Accuracy**: ¬±1% of original peak values
- **Area Under Curve**: Maintain total resource allocation ¬±3%
- **Monotonic Segments**: Preserve increasing/decreasing trends

## Data Structures

### Curve Data Model
```vba
Type ResourceCurve
    Domain As String              ' Work domain name
    OriginalDuration As Integer   ' Original curve duration (months)
    DataPoints() As Double        ' Resource values array
    TimePoints() As Double        ' Time positions array
    KeyPoints As Collection       ' Critical points collection
    Metadata As Dictionary        ' Curve properties
End Type
```

### Stretch Configuration
```vba
Type StretchConfig
    TargetDuration As Integer     ' Desired curve duration
    PreservePeaks As Boolean      ' Maintain peak timing
    PreserveArea As Boolean       ' Maintain total allocation
    SmoothingFactor As Double     ' Post-processing smoothing
    ValidationLevel As String     ' "Basic", "Standard", "Strict"
End Type
```

## Algorithm Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Input Validation
- Verify curve data integrity
- Check duration parameters
- Validate data point count
- Ensure monotonic time sequence

### Step 2: Curve Preprocessing
- Normalize time scale (0-1)
- Identify outliers and anomalies
- Apply initial smoothing if needed
- Calculate basic curve statistics

### Step 3: Key Point Extraction
- Detect peaks using derivative analysis
- Identify valleys and inflection points
- Calculate point importance weights
- Store critical timing relationships

### Step 4: Stretch Calculation
- Calculate overall stretch factor
- Map key points to new timeline
- Preserve relative positioning
- Maintain peak-to-peak ratios

### Step 5: Value Interpolation
- Apply cubic spline interpolation
- Ensure curve smoothness
- Preserve monotonic segments
- Calculate intermediate values

### Step 6: Validation and Adjustment
- Check shape fidelity metrics
- Validate resource allocation totals
- Apply smoothing if needed
- Generate quality assessment

## Quality Metrics

### Shape Fidelity Measurements
1. **Peak Correlation**: Compare peak timing and values (Target: >95%)
2. **Area Preservation**: Total resource allocation deviation (Target: <3%)
3. **Trend Preservation**: Maintain increasing/decreasing segments (Target: 100%)
4. **Smoothness Index**: Measure curve continuity (Target: >90%)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Processing Time**: <2 seconds per curve
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB per operation
- **Numerical Precision**: 4 decimal places
- **Curve Resolution**: Up to 100 data points

## Error Handling

### Input Validation Errors
- **Invalid Duration**: Duration must be positive integer
- **Insufficient Data**: Minimum 5 data points required
- **Non-monotonic Time**: Time points must be sequential
- **Invalid Values**: Resource values must be non-negative

### Algorithm Errors
- **Numerical Instability**: Switch to linear interpolation
- **Peak Detection Failure**: Use simplified peak finding
- **Memory Overflow**: Reduce curve resolution
- **Convergence Issues**: Apply alternative smoothing

### Quality Validation Errors
- **Shape Fidelity Low**: Increase interpolation resolution
- **Area Deviation High**: Apply normalization correction
- **Peak Timing Error**: Adjust key point mapping
- **Smoothness Issues**: Apply post-processing filters

# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Parent Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next condition check |1. Stop all processing 2. Respond with "Parent Capability is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed."  |
| Enabler Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Enabler is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed." |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
