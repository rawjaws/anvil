## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Document Lifecycle Testing
**Purpose**: Validate complete document creation, editing, and management workflow

**Test Steps**:
1. **Document Creation**: Create new capability using template
   - Navigate to specifications folder
   - Click "Create New Capability"
   - Verify template loads with proper metadata
   - Fill out capability form with test data
   - Save and verify file creation

2. **Document Editing**: Modify created capability
   - Open capability in edit mode
   - Switch between Form and Markdown modes
   - Add requirements and dependencies
   - Save changes and verify persistence

3. **Document Viewing**: Verify document display
   - View document in read-only mode
   - Verify markdown rendering and formatting
   - Check metadata display and accuracy

4. **Document Deletion**: Clean up test data
   - Delete test capability
   - Verify file removal and backup creation

**Expected Results**:
- All operations complete without errors
- Data persists accurately between sessions
- UI remains responsive throughout workflow

### Scenario 2: Navigation and Routing Testing
**Purpose**: Validate all navigation paths and UI components

**Test Steps**:
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Test all navigation links
   - Click each capability and enabler in sidebar
   - Verify correct document loading
   - Test active state highlighting

2. **Header Navigation**: Test header button functionality
   - Click Dashboard, Analytics, Agents buttons
   - Verify correct page routing
   - Test medieval-themed buttons (Oracle, etc.)

3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Test navigation consistency
   - Navigate through nested document structure
   - Verify correct breadcrumb display
   - Test back/forward navigation

**Expected Results**:
- All navigation links function correctly
- Page routing works without JavaScript errors
- Active states and highlighting work properly

### Scenario 3: Form and Data Validation Testing
**Purpose**: Validate form functionality and data integrity

**Test Steps**:
1. **Form Field Validation**: Test input validation
   - Enter invalid data in required fields
   - Verify validation error messages
   - Test field character limits and formatting

2. **Table Management**: Test dynamic table operations
   - Add/remove requirements in enabler forms
   - Verify automatic ID generation
   - Test table sorting and filtering

3. **Data Persistence**: Verify data retention
   - Enter data and navigate away
   - Return to form and verify data preserved
   - Test auto-save functionality

**Expected Results**:
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Dynamic tables function correctly
- Data persists accurately across sessions

## Acceptance Criteria

- Configure test workspace with sample documents
- Prepare test data scenarios
- Setup monitoring for performance metrics

### Task 2: Execute Core Functionality Tests
- Run document lifecycle scenarios
- Validate navigation and routing
- Test form and data validation

### Task 3: Performance Validation
- Measure response times for all operations
- Verify performance targets met
- Identify any optimization opportunities

### Task 4: User Experience Validation
- Test interface responsiveness
- Validate mobile compatibility
- Confirm error handling and recovery

### Task 5: Documentation and Reporting
- Document all test results using Anvil
- Create detailed findings report
- Provide recommendations for improvements

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Document templates must be available and functional
- Server infrastructure must be operational
- Database/file system must be accessible

### External Dependencies
- Modern web browser for testing
- Adequate system resources for performance testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Data Loss**: Core functionality failures could result in document corruption
- **Performance**: Poor response times could impact user experience
- **Navigation**: Broken routing could make system unusable

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Backup Validation**: Verify backup system functions before destructive testing
- **Incremental Testing**: Test individual components before complex workflows
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain system restore capability
