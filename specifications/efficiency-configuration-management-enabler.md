## Technical Overview
### Purpose
Provides platform-specific efficiency table management with both global and per-domain configuration options. This enabler allows users to define efficiency curves that reflect learning effects where subsequent applications of a platform become more efficient (e.g., 100% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 65%), with flexibility to apply these curves globally across all domains or customize per individual work domain.

## Configuration Storage Architecture

### Worksheet Storage Structure
- **EfficiencyConfig** worksheet contains all platform configurations
- **ConfigTemplates** worksheet stores default templates
- **ConfigBackup** worksheet maintains configuration history
- **ConfigValidation** worksheet holds validation rules and lookups

### Data Organization
```
EfficiencyConfig Worksheet:
Column A: Platform ID
Column B: Platform Name
Column C: Efficiency Mode
Column D-AG: Global Efficiency Values (V1-V30)
Column AH-XX: Domain-specific efficiency tables (7 domains √ó 30 values)
```

## Configuration Import/Export

### Export Format (CSV)
```csv
Platform,Mode,V1,V2,V3,V4,V5,...,V30
Platform_A,Global,100,80,65,55,50,...,25
Platform_B,PerDomain,Domain_Data_Reference,...
```

### Import Validation
- File format validation
- Data type checking
- Range validation (1%-100%)
- Logical progression validation
- Platform name uniqueness

## Performance Optimization

### Configuration Loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Load configurations only when accessed
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used configurations in memory
- **Batch Operations**: Load multiple platform configs in single operation
- **Background Loading**: Pre-load configurations during system idle time

### Memory Management
- **Configuration Compression**: Store only non-default values
- **Reference Sharing**: Share common efficiency patterns between platforms
- **Garbage Collection**: Clean up unused configuration objects
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track configuration memory usage

## Error Handling

### Configuration Errors
- **Invalid Efficiency Values**: Values outside 1%-100% range
- **Logical Inconsistency**: Increasing efficiency values (anti-learning)
- **Missing Configurations**: Platform without efficiency definition
- **Corrupt Data**: Configuration data integrity issues

### Recovery Procedures
- **Default Fallback**: Use default efficiency template
- **Validation Correction**: Auto-correct minor validation issues
- **Backup Restoration**: Restore from previous valid configuration
- **User Notification**: Clear error messages and resolution steps

### Validation Messages
```vba
Public Enum ValidationMessage
    EfficiencyOutOfRange = "Efficiency value must be between 1% and 100%"
    EfficiencyIncreasing = "Efficiency should not increase (learning effect expected)"
    FirstValueNot100 = "First application should be 100% (baseline)"
    TooManyPrograms = "Maximum 30 vehicle programs per platform supported"
    InvalidDomainName = "Domain name not recognized"
End Enum
```

# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Parent Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next condition check |1. Stop all processing 2. Respond with "Parent Capability is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed."  |
| Enabler Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Enabler is not approved. Both Parent Capability and Enabler status must be 'Approved' to proceed." |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[ ] Both approval statuses verified
-[ ] Decision made (proceed/stop)
-[ ] Appropriate response provided

---

## Task 2: Analysis

#### Critical Rules

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: After implementing code, you MUST update the status of ALL requirements that were implemented. This is not optional - it's a mandatory part of the implementation task.

## Notes
This enabler is central to the flexibility of the efficiency modeling system. It must provide an intuitive interface for users to configure platform-specific learning curves while maintaining data integrity and supporting both global and domain-specific efficiency patterns.
