## Technical Overview
### Purpose
Provides pattern-preserving resource curve stretching and domain-specific resource allocation management. This capability enables the system to take domain-specific resource curves (e.g., 48-month curves) and stretch or compress them to fit actual vehicle program timelines (e.g., 35 months) while preserving the original curve shape, peaks, and valleys.

### Resource Curve Architecture
The Resource Curve Engine provides:

1. **Pattern Preservation**: Maintains the shape and characteristics of original resource curves during time adjustments
2. **Domain-Specific Templates**: Pre-configured curves for each work domain (Design, SW Dev, V&V, DevSecOps, OTA, Release, QA)
3. **Mathematical Stretching**: Algorithms that compress or expand timeline while preserving peak/valley ratios
4. **Validation Framework**: Ensures stretched curves maintain logical resource allocation patterns

### Domain Resource Curves
Default domains supported:
- **Design** (Architecture Systems Engineering)
- **Software Development** (includes SW management, L1/L2 testing)
- **Verification & Validation** (L3/L4 testing)
- **DevSecOps**
- **OTA** (Over-The-Air updates)
- **Release**
- **Quality Assurance**

### Curve Stretching Algorithm
1. **Identify Key Points**: Detect peaks, valleys, and inflection points in original curve
2. **Calculate Stretch Factor**: Determine ratio between target timeline and original curve duration
3. **Preserve Ratios**: Maintain relative timing of peaks and valleys
4. **Interpolate Values**: Calculate intermediate values while preserving curve shape
5. **Validate Output**: Ensure stretched curve maintains logical resource patterns

### Technical Requirements
- **Curve Accuracy**: Maintain 95% shape fidelity during stretching operations
- **Performance**: Process curve calculations for 30 programs in under 2 seconds
- **Validation**: Automatic detection of invalid curve configurations
- **Flexibility**: Support custom curve definitions beyond default templates

# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[ ] Both approval statuses verified
-[ ] Decision made (proceed/stop)
-[ ] Appropriate response provided
