## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# WebSocket connectivity tests
npm test tests/feature-teams/realtime-collaboration/websocket-tests.test.js

# Collaborative editing tests
npm test tests/feature-teams/realtime-collaboration/collaborative-editing.test.js

# Operational transform edge cases
npm test tests/feature-teams/realtime-collaboration/operational-transform-edge-cases.test.js

# User presence tests
npm test tests/feature-teams/realtime-collaboration/user-presence-tests.test.js

# Integration tests
npm test tests/realtime-integration/frontend-backend-integration.test.js

# Performance tests
npm test tests/realtime-integration/websocket-performance.test.js
```

### Automated Test Runner

```bash
# Run all real-time collaboration tests with comprehensive reporting
node scripts/test-realtime.js

# Make sure server is running first
npm start &
node scripts/test-realtime.js
```

The automated runner provides:
- Pre-flight health checks
- Sequential test execution to avoid conflicts
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Comprehensive JSON and HTML reports
- Performance metrics and analysis
- Error tracking and diagnostics

### Test Reports

Test results are saved to `test-results/realtime/` with:
- Detailed JSON reports with full test data
- HTML reports with visual summaries
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Error logs and failure analysis

## Test Environment Requirements

### Server Dependencies
- WebSocket server running on port 3000
- Collaborative reviews feature enabled
- Real-time collaboration endpoints active

### Performance Considerations
- Tests create 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- Large message payloads (up to 100KB) are tested
- Memory usage is monitored during execution
- Network latency simulation included

### Cleanup and Isolation
- All tests clean up WebSocket connections
- Document state is isolated between tests
- Server resources are monitored and cleaned
- No persistent state between test runs

## Success Criteria

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All WebSocket connections establish successfully
- ✅ Document synchronization maintains consistency
- ✅ Operational transform preserves document integrity
- ✅ Conflict resolution handles edge cases gracefully
- ✅ User presence updates in real-time
- ✅ Performance scales to 100+ concurrent users
- ✅ Error recovery maintains system stability
- ✅ Integration tests validate full end-to-end flow

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ Connection establishment: < 5 seconds for 100 connections
- ✅ Message throughput: > 100 messages per second
- ✅ Operation latency: < 500ms for standard operations
- ✅ Memory usage: < 150MB for 75 concurrent connections
- ✅ Cleanup efficiency: < 5 seconds for 50 connections

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test files in appropriate directories
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Add to automated test runner configuration
5. Update documentation and coverage metrics

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor connection limits and adjust test parameters
- Track memory usage patterns during development
- Benchmark against production load requirements
- Update performance thresholds as system evolves

### Debugging Failed Tests
- Check server health and feature flags
- Review WebSocket connection logs
- Analyze test timing and potential race conditions
- Verify test isolation and cleanup procedures

This testing suite ensures the real-time collaboration system is robust, performant, and reliable under all operating conditions.
