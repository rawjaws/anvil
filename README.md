*Anvil's clean interface showing capability management with structured metadata, enabler relationships, and comprehensive status tracking*

## Philosophy & Focus

Anvil is specifically designed for the **right side of the engineering problem** - the **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** that form the architectural foundation of software systems.

Product development has two distinct sides:
- **Left Side (Creative Design Space)**: Experiences and Features - the domain of Product Managers and UX designers
- **Right Side (Technical Implementation)**: Technical Capabilities and Enablers - the domain of Engineers and Architects

Anvil focuses exclusively on the right side, helping engineering teams define, organize, and manage the technical capabilities that enable product experiences. A new platform is coming soon for the left side that will marry **Experiences and Features** (Product Managers) with **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** (Engineers) to build the architectural runway needed to support exceptional user experiences.

## Overview

Anvil provides a clean, organized interface for defining product specifications that automatically transform into working software through AI-powered development workflows.

## Document Conventions

### **File Naming**
- Capabilities: `name-capability.md`
- Enablers: `name-enabler.md`
- Templates: `type-template.md`

### **Document Format**
All documents follow this metadata structure:
```markdown
# [Document Title]

## Metadata
- **Type**: Capability | Enabler
- **ID**: CAP-XXXX | ENB-XXXX
- **Description**: Brief description of what this document covers
- **Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved | etc.
- **Priority**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- **Owner**: [Team/Person]
- **Created Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### **Document Relationships**
The system implements a **1-to-Many relationship** between Capabilities and Enablers:

**Capability ‚Üí Enablers (1:Many)**
- One Capability can have many Enablers
- Capabilities contain an "Enablers" table listing all related enablers
- Each table row references an enabler by ID

**Enabler ‚Üí Capability (Many:1)**
- Each Enabler belongs to exactly one Capability
- Enablers contain a **Capability ID** metadata field linking to parent capability
- **Capability ID**: CAP-XXXX (Parent Capability)

**Relationship Metadata Fields:**
- **Capabilities**: Include Enablers table with columns: Enabler ID, Name, Description, Status, Priority
- **Enablers**: Include **Capability ID** field in metadata section

### **Dependency Rules**
The system enforces specific dependency constraints based on document type:

**Capability Dependencies:**
- **Cross-System Dependencies**: Capabilities can have dependencies on other Capabilities or system components from different systems/projects
- **External Integration**: Supports dependencies across organizational boundaries and technical architectures
- **Flexible Scope**: No restrictions on dependency relationships for capabilities

**Enabler Dependencies:**
- **Same-Component Constraint**: Enablers can only have dependencies on other Enablers within the same system component
- **Internal Scope**: Dependencies must remain within the boundary of the parent capability/component
- **Focused Dependencies**: Ensures enabler dependencies stay logically contained within their architectural context

### **Requirements Management (Enablers)**
Enablers support two types of requirements:

**Functional Requirements Table:**
- Req ID, Requirement, Description, Priority, Status (5 columns)
- Supports adding/removing requirements dynamically in form editor
- Requirements persist correctly between edit sessions

**Non-Functional Requirements Table:**
- Req ID, Type, Requirement, Target Value, Priority, Status, Test Approach
- Type options: Performance, Reliability, Usability, Security, Scalability, Maintainability
- Supports adding/removing requirements dynamically in form editor
- Requirements persist correctly between edit sessions

- **Active Workspace**: Only one workspace is active at a time, determining which documents are visible
- **Centralized Templates**: Single templates directory shared across all workspaces

#### Configuration Structure (config.json)
```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "id": "ws-default",
      "name": "Default Workspace",
      "description": "Primary document workspace",
      "isActive": true,
      "projectPaths": ["../specifications", "./docs"],
      "createdDate": "2025-09-17T22:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "activeWorkspaceId": "ws-default",
  "templates": "./templates",
  "server": { "port": 3000 },
  "ui": {
    "title": "Anvil",
    "description": "Product Requirements Document Browser"
  },
  "defaults": {
    "owner": "Product Team",
    "analysisReview": "Not Required",
    "designReview": "Required"
  }
}
```

#### Workspace API Endpoints
- `GET /api/workspaces` - Get all workspaces and active workspace ID
- `POST /api/workspaces` - Create new workspace
- `PUT /api/workspaces/:id` - Update workspace details
- `POST /api/workspaces/:id/activate` - Set workspace as active
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` - Delete workspace (cannot delete active workspace)
- `POST /api/workspaces/:id/paths` - Add project path to workspace
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/paths` - Remove project path from workspace

#### Workspace Validation
- Each workspace must have at least one project path
- Active workspace ID must reference an existing workspace
- Cannot delete the currently active workspace
- Project paths are validated for existence and security

#### Configuration Migration
The system uses workspace-based configuration. Legacy path-based configurations are automatically migrated to the workspace structure.


## Technical Features

### üìã **Document Creation & Management**
- **Use Form Mode First**: Create new documents using Form mode for structured input, then switch to Markdown mode if needed for custom formatting
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow the established naming conventions (CAP-XXXX for capabilities, ENB-XXXX for enablers)
- **Complete Metadata**: Always fill out Status, Priority, Owner, and Approval fields for proper workflow tracking
- **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear, concise titles that describe the capability or enabler's purpose

### üîó **Relationships & Dependencies**
- **Link Enablers to Capabilities**: Always associate enablers with their parent capability using the Capability ID field
- **Document Dependencies**: Use Internal Upstream/Downstream sections to track capability relationships
- **Requirement Traceability**: Link requirements to implementation tasks and maintain requirement IDs consistently

### üèóÔ∏è **Workspace Organization**
- **Logical Path Structure**: Organize project paths by system/component (e.g., ./auth-system/specifications, ./payment-system/specifications)
- **Workspace Separation**: Use separate workspaces for different projects or environments
- **Template Consistency**: Customize templates to match your organization's standards before creating new documents

### üîÑ **Workflow Management**
- **Status Progression**: Follow the defined status progression (Ready ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Implemented)
- **Approval Gates**: Use approval fields to control implementation flow and ensure quality gates
- **Regular Updates**: Keep Status and Last Updated fields current to maintain project visibility

### üíæ **Configuration Management**
- **Local Configuration**: Use config.local.json for environment-specific settings (workspace paths, personal defaults)
- **Version Control**: Commit only config.json (factory defaults) to version control, never config.local.json
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly backup your workspace directories and local configuration

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow**
- **Form ‚Üî Markdown Toggle**: Use Form mode for structured editing, Markdown mode for advanced formatting
- **Save Frequently**: Use Ctrl+S to save changes, especially when working on complex documents
- **Review Before Implementation**: Use Ready states to pause and review before moving to implementation phases

### üìä **State Management**
- **Automated Workflows**: Leverage state listeners for automatic status transitions (e.g., requirement refactoring)
- **Batch Operations**: Complete related requirements together to trigger enabler status updates efficiently
- **Status Visibility**: Use the relationship diagrams to visualize system architecture and dependencies

### üöÄ **Performance & Scalability**
- **Document Size**: Keep individual documents focused and reasonably sized for better loading performance
- **Image Management**: Store large images externally and link rather than embedding directly in markdown
- **Regular Cleanup**: Archive or remove obsolete documents to maintain system performance


## Status and Approval Field Structure

### Current Field Configuration

The system uses **separate Status and Approval fields** throughout the application for better workflow management:

#### **Capabilities (Metadata)**
- **Status Options**: Draft, In Review, In Development, Testing, Deployed, Deprecated
- **Approval Options**: Not Approved, Approved
- Both fields appear in document metadata sections
- Automatic conversion: Old "Approved" status ‚Üí "In Development" status + "Approved" approval

#### **Enablers (Metadata)**
- **Status Options**: In Draft, Ready for Analysis, Ready for Analysis Review, In Analysis Review, Ready for Design, In Design, In Design Review, Ready to Implement, In Implementation, Implemented, Refactored
- **Approval Options**: Not Approved, Approved
- **Review Fields**: Analysis Review, Design Review, Requirements Review, Code Review (Required/Not Required)
- Comprehensive 11-stage workflow supporting full development lifecycle from analysis through refactoring

#### **Functional Requirements**
| Req ID | Requirement | Description | Priority | Status | Approval |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|
- **Status Options**: In Draft, Ready for Review, In Review, Ready to Implement, In Implementation, Implemented, Refactored
- **Approval Options**: Not Approved, Approved

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
| Req ID | Type | Requirement | Priority | Status | Approval |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|
- **Status Options**: In Draft, Ready for Review, In Review, Ready to Implement, In Implementation, Implemented, Refactored
- **Approval Options**: Not Approved, Approved
- **Type Options**: Performance, Reliability, Usability, Security, Scalability, Maintainability, Technical Constraint, Portability

#### **Enabler Tables in Capabilities**
| Enabler ID | Name | Description | Status | Approval | Priority |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
- Shows enabler status and approval directly in capability documents

### Backward Compatibility
The system automatically handles legacy formats by converting older table structures to the current 6-column format with separate Status and Approval fields.

## Implementation Plan Logic

The Implementation Plan sections in capabilities and enablers follow a strict approval-based execution flow:

### **Capability Implementation Plan**
1. **Task 1**: Check Capability Approval Status
   - If Approval = "Approved" ‚Üí Continue to Task 2
   - If Approval = "Not Approved" ‚Üí Skip all remaining tasks

2. **Task 2**: Implement Enablers
   - For each enabler, check if Enabler Approval = "Approved"
   - If approved ‚Üí Implement the enabler
   - If not approved ‚Üí Skip that enabler

### **Enabler Implementation Plan**
1. **Task 1**: Check Enabler Approval Status
   - If Approval = "Approved" ‚Üí Continue to Task 2
   - If Approval = "Not Approved" ‚Üí Skip all remaining tasks

2. **Task 2**: Implement Requirements
   - For each requirement, check if Requirement Approval = "Approved"
   - If approved ‚Üí Implement the requirement
   - If not approved ‚Üí Skip that requirement

**Important**: The implementation follows a hierarchical approval model where parent elements must be approved before child elements are considered.

## State Automation Triggers

### State Automation

The system includes automated state management:
- **Requirement ‚Üí Enabler Status Cascade**: When any requirement in an enabler becomes "Refactored" AND the enabler status is "Implemented" ‚Üí enabler status changes to "Refactored"
- **Event-driven Architecture**: State changes trigger automated behaviors across the document hierarchy
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes are reflected immediately across related documents
