## Technical Overview
### Purpose

### Efficiency Curve Architecture
The Application Efficiency Curves capability provides:

1. **Global Efficiency Mode**: Apply same efficiency curve to all domains
2. **Per-Domain Efficiency Mode**: Custom efficiency curves for each work domain
3. **Platform Independence**: Each platform has its own efficiency configuration
4. **User-Defined Values**: Efficiency percentages based on platform optimization level
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Support up to 30 vehicle programs per platform

### Efficiency Configuration Options

#### Global Efficiency Example:
```
Platform A - Global Efficiency:
Vehicle 1: 100%  Vehicle 2: 80%  Vehicle 3: 65%  Vehicle 4: 55%...
```

#### Per-Domain Efficiency Example:
```
Platform A - Per Domain:
                V1    V2    V3    V4 ...
Design:        100%   80%   65%   55%
SW Dev:        100%   85%   70%   60%
V&V:           100%   75%   60%   50%
DevSecOps:     100%   80%   65%   55%
OTA:           100%   90%   80%   75%
Release:       100%   85%   75%   70%
QA:            100%   80%   70%   60%
```

### Platform-Specific Examples

#### Well-Optimized Platform (gradual efficiency gains):
```
Platform X: Vehicle 1=100%, Vehicle 2=90%, Vehicle 3=85%, Vehicle 4=82%...
```

#### Less-Optimized Platform (significant efficiency gains):
```
Platform Y: Vehicle 1=100%, Vehicle 2=70%, Vehicle 3=50%, Vehicle 4=40%...
```

### Resource Calculation Integration
```
Final Resource = Base Resource √ó Platform Multiplier √ó Efficiency Multiplier

Where Efficiency Multiplier comes from:
- Global Mode: Platform efficiency table [Vehicle Sequence]
- Per-Domain Mode: Platform efficiency table [Domain][Vehicle Sequence]
```

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform Support**: Independent efficiency curves for up to 10 platforms
- **Vehicle Programs**: Support up to 30 programs per platform
- **Domain Support**: All 7 work domains with individual configuration
- **Performance**: Calculate efficiency multipliers for all programs in under 1 second
- **Validation**: Ensure efficiency percentages are between 1% and 100%
- **Configuration Storage**: Persistent storage of efficiency curve configurations

# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[ ] Both approval statuses verified
-[ ] Decision made (proceed/stop)
-[ ] Appropriate response provided

---

**Purpose**: Analyze the current capability and determine what new enablers or modifications need to be made.

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
