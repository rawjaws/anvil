### Program & Platform Architecture
The Program & Platform Modeling capability provides:

1. **Job 1 Timeline Calculation**: Convert Job 1 production dates and program durations into development start dates and milestones
2. **Platform Application Logic**: Calculate application-specific work based on platform characteristics and multipliers
3. **Shared Work Distribution**: Allocate shared platform development work across multiple vehicle applications
4. **Application Sequencing**: Track which application is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. for each platform to enable efficiency curves
5. **Resource Calculation**: Combine base resources √ó platform multipliers √ó efficiency multipliers

### Platform-Application Relationship
- **Platform Work**: Shared development work that benefits all applications of a platform
- **Application Work**: Vehicle-specific customization (calibrations, branding, testing)
- **Efficiency Curves**: Learning curve effects where subsequent applications require fewer resources
- **Platform Multipliers**: Platform-specific factors that influence application work complexity

### Calculation Logic
```
Total Resource = (Platform Work / Number of Applications) + 
                (Application Work √ó Platform Multiplier √ó Efficiency Multiplier)

Where:
- Platform Work: Shared development allocated across all applications
- Application Work: Base application work from resource curves
- Platform Multiplier: Platform-specific complexity factor
- Efficiency Multiplier: Learning curve factor (100%, 80%, 65%...)
```

### Technical Requirements
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Calculate development timelines within ¬±1 week accuracy
- **Platform Support**: Handle up to 10 different platforms simultaneously
- **Application Tracking**: Support up to 30 vehicle programs per platform
- **Performance**: Complete calculations for all programs in under 3 seconds
- **Validation**: Detect and flag invalid platform/application configurations

# Development Plan

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the enabler to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
-[ ] Both approval statuses verified
-[ ] Decision made (proceed/stop)
-[ ] Appropriate response provided

---

## Task 2: Analysis
**Purpose**: Analyze the current capability and determine what new enablers or modifications need to be made.
