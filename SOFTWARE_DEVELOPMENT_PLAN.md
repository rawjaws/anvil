## Command Examples:

**For Discovery (Documentation Only):**
```
Claude, please read the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md and perform DISCOVERY ONLY on this project. Create specifications documentation but DO NOT implement anything.
```

**For Implementation (After Discovery Complete):**
```
Claude, please read the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md (following the development plan exactly) and develop the application  specified in the specifications folder.

```

## Core Principles

### Components-Capabilities-Enablers-Requirements Model
- **Components** are logical software systems or applications that contain capabilities
- **Capabilities** represent high-level business functions within components that deliver value to users
- **Enablers** are technical implementations that realize capabilities through specific functionality
- **Requirements** define specific functional and non-functional needs within enablers

### Quality and Governance
- All development follows strict approval workflows
- Pre-condition verification prevents bypassing of quality gates
- State-based progression ensures proper task sequencing

### Documentation-First Approach
- Specifications are created before implementation
- Technical diagrams and designs guide development
- All artifacts are version controlled and traceable

# TASK: DISCOVERY

## üö® CRITICAL WARNING - DISCOVERY LIMITATIONS üö®

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION FROM DISCOVERY
- **DISCOVERY MUST STOP AT DESIGN PHASE**
- **NEVER MOVE TO TASK 4: IMPLEMENTATION DURING DISCOVERY**
- **DISCOVERY IS FOR DOCUMENTATION ONLY - NOT IMPLEMENTATION**

### üõ°Ô∏è DISCOVERY SAFETY RULES:
1. **DOCUMENT ONLY**: Discovery creates documentation, never code
2. **STOP AT DESIGN**: Maximum progression is through TASK 3: DESIGN
3. **NO CODE CHANGES**: Never modify, create, or delete application code during discovery
4. **NO FILE OVERWRITES**: Never overwrite existing application files
5. **READ-ONLY ANALYSIS**: Discovery is purely analytical and documentation-focused

### üö´ FORBIDDEN DURING DISCOVERY:
- Writing any application code
- Modifying existing source files
- Creating new application components
- Deleting or moving application files
- Running build processes on discovered applications
- Installing dependencies in discovered applications
- Making any changes that could break the existing application

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED DURING DISCOVERY:
- Reading and analyzing existing code
- Creating capability and enabler documentation in specifications/ folder
- Creating dependency diagrams
- Documenting current architecture
- Analyzing requirements and technical debt
- Creating design documents for future implementation

## Purpose
Analyze existing projects and create structured Capabilities and Enablers within the Anvil framework. Use this when examining codebases, applications, or systems to reverse-engineer their architecture **FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY**.

## Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis
1. **Examine Project Structure**
   - Review directory structure and file organization
   - Identify main application components, modules, and services
   - Look for configuration files, documentation, and build scripts
   - Note frameworks, libraries, and technologies used

2. **Identify Core Functionality**
   - Analyze entry points (main files, startup scripts)
   - Review API endpoints, routes, or service interfaces
   - Examine data models, schemas, and database structures
   - Identify user-facing features and business logic

3. **Map Dependencies**
   - Internal component relationships
   - External service integrations
   - Database dependencies
   - Third-party library usage

### Phase 2: Capability Identification

#### What is a Capability?
A Capability represents a high-level business function or feature within a Component that delivers value to users. Components have Capabilities, and each Capability is composed of multiple Enablers that work together to implement the capability.

#### Capability Discovery Rules:
- **Business Value Focus**: Each capability should represent a distinct business function
- **User-Centric**: Capabilities should be meaningful to end users or business stakeholders
- **Independence**: Capabilities should be largely self-contained with clear boundaries
- **Granularity**: Not too broad (entire application) or too narrow (single function)

#### Common Capability Patterns:
- **User Management**: Authentication, authorization, user profiles
- **Data Management**: CRUD operations for core business entities
- **Integration**: External service connections, API management
- **Reporting**: Analytics, dashboards, data visualization
- **Communication**: Notifications, messaging, alerts
- **Security**: Access control, encryption, audit logging
- **Configuration**: Settings, preferences, system configuration

### Phase 3: Enabler Identification

#### What is an Enabler?
An Enabler is a specific technical implementation that realizes a Capability. Enablers implement Capabilities by adhering to specific Requirements. Each Enabler represents concrete functionality, services, or technical solutions.

#### Enabler Discovery Rules:
- **Technical Focus**: Enablers represent actual code components, services, or implementations
- **Capability Alignment**: Each enabler must belong to exactly one capability
- **Implementation Specific**: Maps to actual files, classes, modules, or services
- **Testable**: Should have clear inputs, outputs, and testable behavior

#### Common Enabler Patterns:
- **API Endpoints**: REST endpoints, GraphQL resolvers
- **Database Operations**: Data access layers, repositories
- **User Interface Components**: Pages, forms, components
- **Business Logic**: Services, validators, processors
- **Infrastructure**: Configuration, deployment, monitoring
- **Security Components**: Authentication handlers, authorization middleware

### Phase 4: Document Creation

#### File Creation Process
1. Create `specifications/` directory relative to SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
2. Create capability files first: `{numeric-id}-capability.md`
3. Create enabler files in same directory: `{numeric-id}-enabler.md`
4. Ensure proper metadata relationships between capabilities and enablers

#### Capability Template Structure:
```markdown
# [Capability Name]

## Metadata
- **Name**: [Business Function Name]
- **Type**: Capability
- **System**: [System Name]
- **Component**: [Component Name]
- **ID**: CAP-123456
- **Owner**: [Team/Person]
- **Status**: In Draft
- **Approval**: Not Approved
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Analysis Review**: [Required/Not Required]

## Purpose
[Clear business value statement explaining what business problem this solves]

## Enablers
| ID | Name | Status | Priority |
|----|----|-----|---------|
| ENB-654321 | [Enabler Name] | In Draft | [Priority] |

## Dependencies
[List other capabilities this depends on]

## Success Criteria
[Measurable criteria for determining when this capability is successfully implemented]

## Risks and Assumptions
[Key risks and assumptions for this capability]
```

#### Enabler Template Structure:
```markdown
# [Enabler Name]

## Metadata
- **Name**: [Technical Implementation Name]
- **Type**: Enabler
- **ID**: ENB-654321
- **Capability ID**: CAP-123456
- **Owner**: [Team/Person]
- **Status**: In Draft
- **Approval**: Not Approved
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Analysis Review**: [Required/Not Required]
- **Code Review**: [Required/Not Required]

## Purpose
[Technical function description]

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Status | Priority |
|----|------------|--------|----------|
| FR-789012 | [Requirement Description] | In Draft | [Priority] |

### Non-Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Status | Priority |
|----|------------|--------|----------|
| NFR-345678 | [NFR Description] | In Draft | [Priority] |

## Technical Specifications (Template)
[Detailed technical implementation details]

## Dependencies
[External dependencies, APIs, services]

## Testing Strategy
[How this enabler will be tested]
```

### Critical Rules for Discovery:
1. **Scan for existing IDs** - Always check all markdown files for ID collisions before creating new ones
2. **Use numeric filename format** - Extract numeric part from full ID (remove CAP- or ENB- prefix)
3. **Create specifications/ directory** - Always relative to SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md location
4. **Group enablers with capabilities** - Place enablers in same directory as parent capability
5. **Maintain relationships** - Always specify capabilityId in enabler metadata
6. **Follow collision detection** - Use provided algorithm to ensure unique IDs

## üö® FINAL CRITICAL REMINDER - DISCOVERY SAFETY üö®

### DISCOVERY = DOCUMENTATION ONLY
- **Discovery creates specifications, never code**
- **Discovery analyzes existing systems without modification**
- **Discovery STOPS at design phase to prevent application overwrites**
- **Discovery is READ-ONLY analysis for documentation purposes**

### WHEN TO USE DISCOVERY:
- Analyzing existing codebases for documentation
- Reverse-engineering applications into Anvil specifications
- Creating architectural documentation
- Planning future enhancements (documentation only)

### WHEN NOT TO USE DISCOVERY:
- Building new applications (use full development plan)
- Modifying existing applications (use analysis ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation)
- Fixing bugs in running systems (use targeted implementation tasks)

# CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### APPROVAL vs STATE - FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE:
- **Approval Definition**: Authorization/permission to proceed when workflow reaches appropriate state
- **State**: Current position in the development workflow that MUST be followed sequentially
- **Pre-condition Verification**: Never change value of a condition to make the condition true. This is not a set.
- **KEY RULE**: NEVER skip states even if approved - approval only grants permission, not workflow bypass
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never modify pre-condition values.

### STATE MACHINE COMPLIANCE:
- Always respect the current **State** field value
- Follow tasks order in strict sequential order
- Each task moves the capability to the next appropriate state
- Approval status does NOT override state requirements

### FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:
- Do NOT jump out of task order
- Do NOT skip analysis, design, or review phases based on approval alone
- Do NOT assume any workflow steps are complete without verifying state progression

## Task 1: Approval Verification (MANDATORY)
**Purpose**: Ensure proper authorization before proceeding with any implementation tasks.

### Pre-Conditions Verification
| Condition | Required Value | Action if True | Action if False |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Capability Approval | "Approved" | Continue to next task | Stop all processing, Respond with "Capability not approved."  |

#### Critical Rules
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never ask user to change Pre-Conditions values
- **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**: Stop ALL processing if pre-conditions fail
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Pre-condition failures = MANDATORY STOP
- **WORKFLOW HALT**: Do not proceed past failed pre-condition verification
- **RESPONSE REQUIREMENT**: Must explicitly state "STOPPING due to failed pre-conditions" and explain which conditions failed

### Exit Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Both approval statuses verified

# STANDARDS AND CONVENTIONS

## File Naming and ID Generation Schema

### Unique ID Format:
- **Capabilities**: `CAP-XXXXXX` (e.g., `CAP-123456`)
- **Enablers**: `ENB-XXXXXX` (e.g., `ENB-654321`)
- **Functional Requirements**: `FR-XXXXXX` (e.g., `FR-789012`)
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: `NFR-XXXXXX` (e.g., `NFR-345678`)

### ID Generation Algorithm (Standalone):
**For projects without running Anvil server**, use this algorithm:

```javascript
function generateSemiUniqueNumber() {
  const now = Date.now();
  const timeComponent = parseInt(now.toString().slice(-4));
  const randomComponent = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  const combined = timeComponent * 100 + randomComponent;
  return combined.toString().padStart(6, '0').slice(-6);
}

function findExistingIds(prefix) {
  // Search all markdown files for: **ID**: {prefix}-XXXXXX
  // Return array of found numeric IDs
}

function generateUniqueId(prefix) {
  const existingIds = findExistingIds(prefix);
  let attempts = 0;

  while (attempts < 100) {
    const newNumber = generateSemiUniqueNumber();
    const newId = `${prefix}-${newNumber}`;

    if (!existingIds.includes(newId)) {
      return newId;
    }
    attempts++;
    // Add small delay for different timestamp
  }

  // Fallback: sequential numbering from 100000
  let sequentialNum = 100000;
  while (existingIds.includes(`${prefix}-${sequentialNum}`)) {
    sequentialNum++;
  }
  return `${prefix}-${sequentialNum}`;
}
```

### File Naming Convention:
- **Capabilities**: `{numeric-id}-capability.md` (e.g., `123456-capability.md`)
- **Enablers**: `{numeric-id}-enabler.md` (e.g., `654321-enabler.md`)

**Important**: Do NOT use prefixes like `cap-` or `enb-` in filenames. Extract numeric part from full ID (remove `CAP-` or `ENB-` prefix).

### File Placement Strategy:

**Directory Structure:**
```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specifications/

## Naming Conventions for Capabilities and Enablers

### Driving vs. Driven Naming Strategy

Understanding whether a capability or enabler is **driving** or **being driven** is crucial for establishing clear dependency relationships and communication patterns within your system architecture.

#### **Driven Elements (Nouns)**
Elements that are **being driven** should be named as **nouns** because they represent:
- **Passive resources** that respond to external requests
- **Service providers** that offer functionality to other components
- **Downstream dependencies** that are consumed by other elements

**Characteristics of Driven Elements:**
- Provide services or resources to other components
- React to incoming requests or commands
- Typically represent foundational capabilities that multiple other components depend on
- Often appear as **downstream dependencies** in dependency diagrams

**Examples of Driven Elements (Nouns):**
- **Logging** - Provides logging services to other components
- **Authentication** - Provides authentication services when requested
- **Database Storage** - Provides data persistence services
- **Configuration Management** - Provides configuration data to other systems
- **User Notification** - Provides notification services when triggered

#### **Driving Elements (Verbs)**
Elements that are **driving** should be named as **verbs** or **action phrases** because they represent:
- **Active orchestrators** that initiate processes or workflows
- **Trigger mechanisms** that start chains of operations
- **Upstream dependencies** that coordinate and control other elements

**Characteristics of Driving Elements:**
- Initiate processes, workflows, or operations
- Coordinate multiple other components to achieve business outcomes
- Often represent business processes or user-initiated actions
- Typically appear as **upstream dependencies** in dependency diagrams

**Examples of Driving Elements (Verbs):**
- **Log Startup** - Actively initiates the startup logging process
- **Authenticate User** - Actively orchestrates the user authentication workflow
- **Process Payment** - Actively coordinates the payment processing workflow
- **Generate Report** - Actively triggers report generation processes
- **Send Welcome Email** - Actively initiates the welcome email workflow

#### **Dependency Relationship Patterns**

**Typical Flow Pattern:**
```
[Verb/Driver] ‚îÄ‚îÄdrives‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Noun/Driven]
[Upstream]    ‚îÄ‚îÄuses‚îÄ‚îÄ>   [Downstream]
```

**Example Dependency Relationships:**
- **Log Startup** (verb) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> **Logging** (noun)
- **Authenticate User** (verb) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> **Authentication** (noun)
- **Process Payment** (verb) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> **Payment Gateway** (noun)
- **Generate Report** (verb) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> **Database Storage** (noun)

#### **Visual Relationship Diagram**

    class V1,V2,V3,V4 verb
    class N1,N2,N3,N4 noun

    %% Grouping
    subgraph DRIVERS ["üéØ DRIVING ELEMENTS (Verbs/Actions)"]

        N1
        N2
        N3
        N4
    end
```

**Key Insights from the Diagram:**
- **Blue elements (Verbs)** initiate actions and coordinate other components
- **Purple elements (Nouns)** provide services and respond to requests
- **Arrows show dependency flow** from drivers to services
- **Multiple dependencies are common** - drivers often use multiple services
- **Clear separation** between orchestration logic and service logic

#### **Best Practices for Naming**

1. **Identify the Role First**: Before naming, determine if the element is primarily:
   - **Initiating actions** (use verbs)
   - **Providing services** (use nouns)

2. **Consider the Consumer Perspective**:
   - If other components "call upon" this element, it's likely driven (noun)
   - If this element "orchestrates" other components, it's likely driving (verb)

3. **Use Clear, Business-Meaningful Names**:
   - Avoid technical jargon when business terms are clearer
   - Use names that stakeholders can easily understand
   - Be specific enough to avoid ambiguity

4. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Use consistent naming patterns across similar elements
   - Document your naming conventions for the project team

5. **Examples of Well-Named Pairs**:
   ```
   Driver (Verb)              Driven (Noun)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Log Application Events  ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Application Logging
   ‚îú‚îÄ Validate User Input     ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Input Validation
   ‚îú‚îÄ Backup Database         ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Database Backup Storage
   ‚îú‚îÄ Monitor System Health   ‚îÄ‚îÄ> System Health Monitoring
   ‚îî‚îÄ Route Network Traffic   ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Network Routing
   ```

#### **Impact on Architecture Clarity**

This naming strategy provides several benefits:

- **Clearer Dependency Modeling**: Immediately understand data/control flow direction
- **Better Component Boundaries**: Natural separation between orchestrators and services
- **Improved Communication**: Stakeholders can easily distinguish between active processes and passive resources
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Future developers can quickly understand component roles and relationships
- **Simplified Testing Strategy**: Clear separation between process logic (verbs) and service logic (nouns)
