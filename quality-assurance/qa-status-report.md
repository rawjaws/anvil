## 🔧 Quality Gate Configuration

### Automated Quality Gates
1. **Integration Tests** (Blocking)
   - Command: `npm run test:integration`
   - Threshold: 0% failure rate
   - Action: Block deployment on failures

2. **Performance Baseline** (Blocking)
   - Command: `npm run test:performance`
   - Thresholds: 20% response time increase, 10% throughput decrease
   - Action: Alert and investigation required

3. **Code Quality** (Non-blocking)
   - Command: `npm run lint`
   - Threshold: 0 violations preferred
   - Action: Warning notifications

4. **Feature Isolation** (Blocking)
   - Custom validation script
   - Threshold: 0 conflicts
   - Action: Block deployment on conflicts

### Alert Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Auto-rollback required, deployment blocked
- **High**: Immediate attention, increased monitoring
- **Medium**: Review scheduled, monitoring continued
- **Low**: Logged for analysis

## 📊 Monitoring Strategy

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Frequency**: 30-second intervals for quality checks
- **Performance**: 10-second intervals for regression detection
