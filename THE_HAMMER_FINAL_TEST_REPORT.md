### ❌ **Test Issues Identified**

#### Configuration Issues
- **PreCog Market Engine**: Jest configuration conflicts
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: Identifier 'jest' has already been declared`
- **Impact**: Test suite cannot execute (configuration issue, not functional issue)

#### Document Generator Test Expectations
- **Issue**: Some tests expect different document type classifications
- **Example**: Test expects "test-cases", system returns "requirements"
- **Status**: Functionality works, test expectations may need adjustment

#### Timeout Issues
- **Smart Document Generator**: 1 test timeout (30 seconds)
- **Cause**: Initialization event listener timing
- **Impact**: Isolated timeout issue, core functionality operational
